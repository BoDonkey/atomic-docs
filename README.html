    <h1 class="docBlock-heading">Welcome!</h1>
    <p>Atomic Docs is made for <a href="https://www.previousnext.com.au/blog/style-guide-driven-development-new-web-development">styleguide driven development</a>.</p>
    <p>Requirements: A local PHP enviornment. And a CSS preprocessor.<p> 

    <ol class="docBlock-ul">
        <li>Set up your CSS preprocessor of choice. As expected we will be processing from our SCSS directory to the CSS directory.</li>
        <li>In the lower left hand corner, open the &quot;Manage Categories&quot; form. In the create category field we will create a new component category. In a nod to <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/"> Brad Frost</a>, I&#39;ll call this one &quot;molecules&quot;.
            <img class="docBlock-img" src="atomic-core/img/doc1.png" />
        </li>
        <li>Click on the newly created molecules link in the sidebar to go to the molecules page. In the form below the molecules link let&#39;s create a new component called &quot;calloutBox&quot;.
            <img class="docBlock-img" src="atomic-core/img/doc2.png" />
        </li>
        <li>So next we&#39;ll create the HTML for the calloutBox component. In the project directory you&#39;ll notice a folder named &quot;compontents&quot;. Open that and you&#39;ll find the folder molecules. This is the directory that all of the HTML component files you create under the molecules category will be located. Let&#39;s open the file &quot;calloutBox.php&quot; and put some HTML code there.
            <img class="docBlock-img" src="atomic-core/img/doc3.png" />
        </li>
        <li>Back in our projects directory open up the SCSS folder. You will see the folder molecules and within molecules is the the newly created _calloutBox.scss file. This of course is where we&#39;ll put our styles for the calloutBox component. As a side note, atomic-docs handles wiring up all of the scss &quot;@import&quot; strings. Even if I&#39;m not creating a style guide this feature is sooo time saving.
           <img class="docBlock-img" src="atomic-core/img/doc4.png" />
        </li>
        <li>Now back to our project in the browser. Click on the molecules link in the sidebar and you&#39;ll see our newly created component.
            <img class="docBlock-img docBlock-img__big" src="atomic-core/img/doc5.png" />
        </li>
        <li>And that&#39;s it!</li>
    </ol>

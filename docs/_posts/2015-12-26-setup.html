	<li>Download Atomic Docs and add to your local PHP environment.</li>
	<li>Open the config.php file in the root. Set wether you're SCSS or LESS (default is .scss). Set what you would like the extension of your component files to be, E.G. .html, .php, .mustache (default is .html).</li>
	<li>Set up your preprocessor. The root preprocessed file must be named main.scss (or whatever your extension is) and the processed CSS file must be main.css, of course. </li>
